    "Logistic regression is a form of generalised linear modelling which has a discrete outcome e.g. disease vs no disease, side effect vs no side effect, treatment vs no treatment. \n",

    "When we have a dataset that we wish to apply logistic regression to, we are using sample data to infer information about a true population. We cannot quantify this true populatiom, and therefore, the outputs of our model produce estimates of the true parameters. Because they are estimates, they inevitably have error. It is important to calculate this error along with our estimates when presenting results.\n",

    "In logistic regression, we use Maximum Likelihood Estimation to estimate the odds and odds ratios. A discussion of this is beyond the scope of this workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence Intervals\n",
    "In frequentist statistics (which we are discussing here), 95% confidence intervals represent a range of values, for which, if we repeated our sampling of the true population an infinite number of times, 95% of our estimate ranges would contain the true population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of 95%, whilst widely used in healthcare, is abitrary, and can be replaced with any % value with acceptable false positive rate $\\alpha$ for (100-$\\alpha$)% confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two methods to calculate confidence intervals for logistic regression: Wald-Type and Profile Likelihood\n",
    "- **Wald-Type** Confidence Intervals are similar to what you may have encountered previously, where 95% CIs are given by:\n",

    "$$ Estimate \\pm 1.96 * Estimate Standard Error $$\n",

Given the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in odds of LOS >100 days for severity of illness, P>|z| which represent p-values give us strong evidence to reject this null hypothesis. Therefore, there appears to be an association between illness severity and LOS >100 days. Confidence Intervals for the log-odds are also shown in the model output. We can convert these log values to get 95% CIs for odds and odds ratios. "
